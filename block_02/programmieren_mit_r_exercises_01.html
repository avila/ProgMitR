1.Define the following vectors in R:
        a = sequence from 0 to 8
        b = (1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3)
        c = (1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4)
        d = (1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4)
        
```{r}
a = 0:8
b = c(1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4)
C = c(1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4)
d = c(1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4)
```


    What are the dimensions and lengths of a, b, c and d?

    Create a named vector namedNumbers containing the elements (1, 2, 3, 4) with element names (alpha, beta, gamma and delta)!

    a, b, c and d are defined as before. Check the R Language Definiton 3.1.4, if you are not familiar with the applied operators (e.g. &, |, ==, etc.). Think first, check your results with R. What is the result of:
